# Work Dotfiles
* Shell: zsh + oh my zsh
* Theme: powerlevel10k


## Setup Instructions

Files that should be symlinked to the home directory are stored in the `dotfiles/` folder. [Stow](https://tamerlan.dev/how-i-manage-my-dotfiles-using-gnu-stow/) is a good tool to use for that.

The `.zsh_profile_safe` file must be manually added to the shell configuration. See that file for more instructions.
